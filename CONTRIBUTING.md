# Contributing to API REST para ejemplo uso de git

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the API REST para ejemplo uso de git project.

## About

### Environment variables

The `.env.example` should list all the environment variables that the application needs to run.

A `.env` file with the environement variable key/value pairs can be added at the root of the project. The `dotenv` package imported in `/src/config/index.js` will make those variables available to the app.

### Project structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `/src`: server source files
  - `/api`: API source files
    - `/controllers`: request handlers
    - `/middlewares`: custom middlewares
    - `/routes`: route definitions
  - `/config`: configuration files (database options, logging configuration, etc)
  - `/services`: business logic files
  - `/utils`: utilities and helpers
  - `index.js`: entry point of the application that holds all the Express server configuration (middlewares, routes, error handling...)
- `/test`: test files

When running the app or performing some commands, additional folders (ignored by Git) will be created such as:

- `/logs`: application logs (errors, info, etc...) generated by `winston` when the application is running
- `.nyc_output/`: test coverage output generated by `nyc` after running `npm run test`

### Routing

#### How to

- All routes should be defined in `/src/api`
- For each main route endpoint, two files with the route endpoint as file name should be added to the `/routes` and `/controllers` folders
- All the business logic (retrieving, creating or updating data, etc) should be defined in the `/src/services` folder

#### Example

To define a new endpoint `/articles` and two routes `GET /articles` and `GET /articles/:id`, follow the steps below.

- Create the service with the business logic to retrieve the articles:

  - Create a new file called `article.js` in `/src/services`
  - In this new file, define and export two new methods `getAllArticles` and `getArticleById`:

    ```javascript
    // /src/services/article.js

    module.exports = {
      async getAllArticles() {
        const articles = await Article.findAll();

        return articles;
      },

      async getArticleById(id) {
        const article = await Article.findByPk(id);

        return article;
      },
    };
    ```

- Create the controller:

  - Create a new file `articles.js` in `/src/api/controllers`
  - In this new file, define and export the request handlers associated to these routes:

    ```javascript
    // /src/api/controllers/articles.js

    const ArticleService = require('../../services/article');

    module.exports = {
      async getArticles(req, res, next) {
        const articles = await ArticleService.getAllArticles();

        return articles;
      },

      async getArticle(req, res, next) {
        const { id } = req.params;

        const article = await ArticleService.getArticleById(id);

        return article;
      },
    };
    ```

- Create the route endpoints:

  - Create a new file `articles.js` in `/src/api/routes`
  - In this new file, initialize a router object, import the controller and the new routes with its associated request handlers:

    ```javascript
    // /src/api/routes/articles.js

    const Router = require('express-promise-router').default;

    const articlesController = require('../controllers/articles');

    const router = Router();

    router.get('/', articlesController.getArticles);
    router.get('/:id', articlesController.getArticle);

    module.exports = router;
    ```

- Finally, import the routes in `/src/api/routes/index.js` and declare a new `/articles` route:

  ```javascript
  // /src/api/routes/index.js

  const articlesRouter = require('./articles');

  /**
   * API routes
   */
  router.use('/articles', articlesRouter);
  ```

### Object validation

Object validation (request parameters, request body, etc) should be handled by [celebrate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/celebrate).

To do this, add validation schemas in the route definitions by using the `celebrate` middleware.

For example, to add validation to the `id` parameter of the `GET /articles/:id` route, add the celebrate middleware in `/src/api/routes/articles.js`:

```javascript
const Router = require('express-promise-router').default;
const { celebrate, Joi } = require('celebrate');

const articlesController = require('../controllers/articles');

const router = Router();

/**
 * Get article
 */
router.get(
  '/:id',
  celebrate({
    params: {
      id: Joi.number()
        .integer()
        .positive()
        .required()
        .error(() => 'Article id is required and must be a positive integer.'),
    },
  }),
  articlesController.getArticle
);
```

Validation errors are handled by the `celebrateErrorParser` middleware from [@kazaar/express-error-handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kazaar/express-error-handler).

```javascript
app.use(celebrateErrorParser);
```

### Testing

API tests are defined in the `test/` folder where one test file exists per main route.

The tests are run with [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha), written with [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) and [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) and test coverage is generated by [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) with [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc).

### Error handling

HTTP error responses are handled by the `httpErrorHandler` middleware from [@kazaar/express-error-handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kazaar/express-error-handler).

```javascript
app.use(httpErrorHandler);
```

When an error is thrown inside of a controller with `next()` or `throw`, this middleware will parse the error as a standard HTTP error to retrieve the error details, log the error and send back the error to the client.

To throw custom HTTP errors, use the `http-errors` module:

```javascript
const { NotFound } = require('http-errors');

module.exports = {
  async getArticleById(id) {
    const article = await Article.findByPk(id);

    if (!article) {
      throw new NotFound('Article not found.');
    }

    return article;
  },
};
```

In addition, the routes defined in `/src/api/routes` should use the `Router` from the `express-promise-router` package instead of the `express` package. It provides a convenient way to write async controller methods without `try/catch` blocks and `next()` (see [express-promise-router](https://github.com/express-promise-router/express-promise-router)).

### Logs

When running, the application outputs some logs. Two modules are used for this:

- [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston): handles all application logs and writes the output to configured transports (file, console, etc)
- [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan): logs all incoming HTTP requests

In production mode (`NODE_ENV` set to `production`), the application will not output logs to the console.

Please refer to `/config/logger.js` to see winston configuration.

### Version update

When updating the project's version number, do not forget to update:

- The `version` field in `package.json`
- The `info > version` field in `/src/doc/openapi.yaml`

## Style Guide

### ES6

JavaScript files located in `/src` are written in ES6 syntax (see [ECMAScript 6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp)).

Most of the ES6 features are supported by the latest versions of Node (`async/await`, `let`, `const`...). However, some features like ES6's `import/export` require to be "transpiled" first for Node.js to understand them.

If you want to use ES6's `import/export` syntax instead of the CommonJS `require/module.exports` syntax, use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

### Filenames

All filenames should use `kebab-case`.

### Formatting

Formatting rules are defined in `.editorconfig` and `.prettierrc`.

General formatting rules are:

- Indentation of **2 spaces**
- Max line length of **120 characters**
- **Single quotes** instead of double quotes

The rules defined in `.editorconfig` ensure that the coding style guide will stay consistent between different editors (see [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) for more info).

The rules defined in `.prettierrc` provide more advanced formatting options (see [Linting](#Linting) section below).

### Linting

#### ESLint & Prettier

This project uses:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript errors linting and best practices
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) for code formatting

Two npm commands are available:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run lint:fix`

The first one will check for linting and formatting errors and the second one will try to automatically fix these errors. Under the hood, these two commands run ESlint on `*.js` files and Prettier on `*.{json,md,html,yaml,css}` files. All files and folders defined in `.gitignore` will be ignored.

Configuration for these tools are defined in `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc`. This project essentially uses Airbnb's [JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) along with some eslint plugins to ensure coding best practices.

#### Pre-commit hook

In addition to these commands, a git pre-commit hook runs before each commit to ensure that linting and formatting are ok. All staged files run through the same linting process as the `lint:fix` npm command.

The hook was created with `husky` and configured to run `lint-staged`. It is defined in `package.json`.

More info:

- [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/uz/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)
- [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)

### JSDoc

JavaScript functions should be annotated with [JSDoc](https://devhints.io/jsdoc). This allows to:

- Check the type of JavaScript code during code time
- Facilitate code readability
- Produce code documentation
